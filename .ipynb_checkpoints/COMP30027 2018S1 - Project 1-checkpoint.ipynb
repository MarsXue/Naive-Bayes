    "1. Since we’re starting off with random guesses, it might be surprising that the unsupervised NB works at all. Explain what characteristics of the data cause it to work pretty well (say, within 10% Accuracy of the supervised NB) most of the time; also, explain why it utterly fails sometimes.\n",
    "2. When evaluating supervised NB across the four different datasets, you will observe some variation in effectiveness (e.g. Accuracy). Explain what causes this variation. Describe and explain any particularly suprising results.\n",
    "3. Evaluating the model on the same data that we use to train the model is considered to be a major mistake in Machine Learning. Implement a hold–out (hint: check out numpy.shuffle()) or cross–validation evaluation strategy. How does your estimate of Accuracy change, compared to testing on the training data? Explain why. (The result might surprise you!)\n",
    "4. Implement one of the advanced smoothing regimes (add-k, Good-Turing). Do you notice any variation in the predictions made by either the supervised or unsupervised NB classifiers? Explain why, or why not.\n",
    "5. The lecture suggests that deterministically labelling the instances in the initialisation phase of the unsupervised NB classifier “doesn’t work very well”. Confirm this for yourself, and then demonstrate why.\n",
    "6. Rather than evaluating the unsupervised NB classifier by assigning a class deterministically, instead calculate how far away the probabilistic estimate of the true class is from 1 (where we would be certain of the correct class), and take the average over the instances. Does this performance estimate change, as we alter the number of iterations in the method? Explain why.\n",
    "7. Explore what causes the unsupervised NB classifier to converge: what proportion of instances change their prediction from the random assignment, to the first iteration? From the first to the second? What is the latest iteration where you observe a prediction change? Make some conjecture(s) as to what is occurring here.\n",

    "---\n",
    "From observation, there are several reasons can let unsupervised NB works well. (e.g. \"breast-cancer\", \"hypothyroid\" and \"mushroom\" (optimal))\n",
    "1. **Majority class of dataset**  \n",
    "From the confusion matrix above, it can be seen that both supervised and unsupervised NB in \"hypothyroid\" choose majority class - negative, which get the same accuracy. Since the swapping method can let predictions be the same class, the baseline of unsupervised is 0-R, which allow to choose majority class if possible. Therefore, unsupervised \"breast-cancer\" is also 0-R situation. The baseline of unsupervised NB is the guarantee of accuracy for dataset have majority class.\n",
    "2. **More instances and attributes**  \n",
    "The accuracy of unsupervised \"mushroom\" can be over 89% sometimes, more attributes can be helpful to calculate the prediction probability of class (since you don't know which attribute effect the probability), and more instances can train the model better. Also, all instances in \"mushroom\" is distinguish, so dataset is various which helps to calculate the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason it fails**  \n",
    "Since the class distribution of \"mushroom\" is quite even, if the initial random distribution leads to far away from acutal class, it will diverge, which can be wrong prediciton in this case, and the reason why accuracy of unsupervised \"mushroom\" fails sometimes."

    "The high accuracy value is due to the existing majority class in the dataset (e.g. 3012:151), and the percentage value of majority class can easily effect the prior probability, which furthermore effect the predictions.\n",
    "It can be seen that, assuming hypothyroid as interesting class (patient wanna know diagnose), both precision and recall values are calculated as zero. In this case, since the instance number of actual interesting class is really smal, even the accuracy of supervised NB is quite high, it is still meaningless actually. High accuracy can not guarantee the correctness of true fact."
